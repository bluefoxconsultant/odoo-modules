"""What the transfer RETAINS of its own share link, and the retroactive gate.

The module guards the capability twice — ``token`` is manager-only at rest, and
every backend look goes through the journaled reveal wizard. The chatter walked
around both: ``mail.template.send_mail`` stores the rendered body on the record,
so the live link sat there in clear, readable by anyone allowed to read the
transfer, and nothing in the Loi 25 trail said they had read it.

The rule under test: a link that no recipient code gates IS the credential, so
it must not survive in what the record keeps. A link held behind a code opens
nothing on its own and is left alone — and the predicate is re-read on every
sweep, so turning the instance-wide setting off later blots the old messages.

The companion feature is the retroactive gate: arming the recipient code on a
transfer that is already out (task #24216), which is what makes the rule
actionable instead of merely diagnostic.

Nothing here touches SMTP: the queue is driven by hand and the post-send hook is
called the way mail.mail calls it.
