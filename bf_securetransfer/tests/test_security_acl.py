"""Who can read what, and what a logged-in user cannot reach over RPC.

The module's whole confidentiality story rests on two things the ORM enforces
for us: the share token is manager-only, and the audit trail is read-only even
for managers. Both are one CSV line away from silently opening up, and neither
had a test. The RPC-surface checks matter just as much: a method without a
leading underscore is a public API to anyone holding a session, so a private
helper that quietly became public would hand out OTP codes.
