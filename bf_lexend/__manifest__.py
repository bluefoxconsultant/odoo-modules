        Loads the Lexend variable font and adds it as a selectable option on
        res.company.font. Brand color fields and the Settings UI for them live in
        `bluefox_branding` since 18.0.3.0.0 — install bluefox_branding to manage
        brand colours and white-label settings.

        Lexend CSS is loaded globally; tenants that pick a different font via
        res.company.font will still have the asset present (~120KB total, self-hosted,
        font-display: swap) but the rest of the UI/PDFs will render in the chosen font.
