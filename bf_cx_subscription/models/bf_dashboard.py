"""Revenue-at-risk indicator on the CX dashboard tile.

Same defensive pattern as bf_cx_dashboard: one broken section must never
break the whole dashboard, so this bridge wraps its own computation in a
try/except and only adds a plain float to the summary returned by
_get_cx_summary(). "At risk" means: an active subscription managed for a
client (managed_for_id) whose partner currently has an unhandled feedback
to follow up (needs_followup and not done) or an open complaint. Amounts
are the stored monthly_equivalent of bf_subscription, summed the same
naive way as the subscription dashboard tile.
