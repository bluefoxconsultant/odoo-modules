"""Booking availability: honour show_as='free' on attended events.

Upstream OCA ``resource_booking`` counts a person-resource as busy whenever
their partner attends a calendar event (state != declined), regardless of the
event's ``show_as`` flag. Google-synced all-day events ("Bureau", working
location, "Occupé(e)") arrive with show_as='free' and the synced user as
attendee, stored 08:00→18:00 UTC = 4h→14h Montréal — so every workday morning
was silently removed from the public slot picker (observed in testing,
2026-07-03: the "Questionnaire d'audit initial" type only ever offered
14h/14h30/15h starts Mon-Thu and nothing on Fridays).

Reimplements ``_calendar_event_busy_intervals`` with one change: the attendee
branch only blocks when the event is marked busy, matching the owner branch
and the free/busy semantics of mainstream booking tools. Events linked to
actual resource bookings still always block.
