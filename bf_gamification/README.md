- 15 default badges
- 11 default XP rules
- 2 scheduled jobs (streak reset + badge check)
- Security groups for all internal users
- Retroactive XP backfill for the last 96 hours of work

---

## Configuration

Navigate to **Settings > Fox Quest** (visible to Fox Quest managers).

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Activer Fox Quest | On | Master toggle — disables all XP awarding when off |
| Afficher le classement | On | Show/hide the leaderboard |
| Popups d'achievement | On | Show animated overlays on badge/level-up events |
| Sons | On | Enable audio effects (reserved for future use) |
| Confettis | On | Enable confetti visual effects |
| Jours avant reset du streak | 2 | Days of inactivity before streak resets to 0 |

All settings are stored as `ir.config_parameter` keys prefixed with `bf_gamification.*`.

---

## How It Works

### XP System

XP (experience points) is the core currency. Every tracked action creates an `xp.transaction`
record with the amount, source, description, and a reference to the originating object.

XP rules are fully configurable via **Fox Quest > Configuration > Regles XP**:

| Rule | Source | Trigger | XP | Condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Heure de feuille de temps | Timesheet | Create | 1/h | Per hour logged |
| Journee productive | Timesheet | Daily | 5 | >= 6h billable in a day |
| Streak quotidien | Streak | Daily | 10 | Per consecutive active day |
| Tache completee | Task | Complete | 5 | Task moved to done stage |
| Tache avant deadline | Task | Complete | 10 | Completed on or before deadline |
| Document cree | Document | Create | 3 | New document created |
| Revision document | Document | Write | 2 | Meaningful document update |
| Maintenance completee | Hosting | Complete | 2 | Scheduled maintenance marked done |
| Message poste | Message | Create | 1 | Message or internal note posted in chatter |
| Ticket resolu | Helpdesk | Complete | 3 | Helpdesk ticket moved to resolved stage |
| Activite completee | Activity | Complete | 1 | Scheduled activity marked as done |

Rules can be enabled/disabled, and XP amounts adjusted without code changes.

### Levels

10 fox-themed levels with increasing XP thresholds:

| # | Level | Min XP | Title | CSS Class |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Renardeau | 0 | Louveteau | `level-bronze` |
| 2 | Jeune Renard | 100 | Eclaireur | `level-bronze` |
| 3 | Renard Roux | 300 | Pisteur | `level-silver` |
| 4 | Renard Argente | 750 | Chasseur | `level-silver` |
| 5 | Renard Arctique | 1,500 | Gardien | `level-gold` |
| 6 | Renard Dore | 3,000 | Alpha | `level-gold` |
| 7 | Renard Mystique | 5,000 | Sage | `level-platinum` |
| 8 | Esprit Renard | 8,000 | Oracle | `level-platinum` |
| 9 | Renard Celeste | 12,000 | Legende | `level-diamond` |
| 10 | Kitsune | 20,000 | Kitsune | `level-diamond` |

Levels are editable. Add, remove, or adjust thresholds via
**Fox Quest > Configuration > Niveaux**.

When a user crosses a level threshold, a level-up event is pushed through `bus.bus` and an
animated popup appears in their browser.

### Badges

Badges are visual achievements organized into fox-themed categories:

**Categories:** La Chasse (productivity), Le Terrier (knowledge), La Meute (teamwork), La Taniere (hosting), Les Etoiles (milestones), Le Glapissement (communication)

**Rarity tiers:** Common, Uncommon, Rare, Epic, Legendary — each with distinct visual styling.

**Default badges (15):**

| Badge | Category | XP | Rarity | Condition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Premieres Pattes | La Chasse | 10 | Common | First timesheet entry |
| Queue de Feu | La Chasse | 25 | Uncommon | 7-day streak |
| Renard Infatigable | La Chasse | 100 | Epic | 30-day streak (hidden) |
| Renard Lettre | Le Terrier | 15 | Common | First document created |
| Sage du Terrier | Le Terrier | 50 | Rare | 10 documents created |
| Renard Aventurier | La Meute | 10 | Common | First task completed |
| Renard Implacable | La Meute | 75 | Rare | 50 tasks completed |
| Depanneur | La Meute | 10 | Common | First ticket resolved |
| Renard Serviable | La Meute | 50 | Rare | 25 tickets resolved |
| Gardien de la Taniere | La Taniere | 10 | Common | First maintenance done |
| Premier Glapissement | Le Glapissement | 10 | Common | First message posted |
| Renard Bavard | Le Glapissement | 25 | Uncommon | 50 messages posted |
| Renard d'Argent | Les Etoiles | 25 | Uncommon | Reach 500 XP |
| Renard Endurant | Les Etoiles | 50 | Uncommon | 100h of timesheets |
| Renard d'Or | Les Etoiles | 100 | Epic | Reach 5,000 XP (hidden) |

**Condition types:**

| Type | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Manual | Granted by a manager via the wizard |
| Automatic | Awarded when a record count threshold is met on a monitored model |
| Threshold | Awarded when the user's total XP reaches a value |

Automatic and threshold badges are checked on every XP award and by a scheduled job every 6 hours.

**Popup effects** (configurable per badge): `confetti`, `fireworks`, `glow`, `shake`, or `none`.

### Streaks

A streak counts consecutive days where a user earns XP. The streak increments when XP is awarded
on a new day, provided the gap since the last activity is within the configured reset threshold
(default: 2 days).

A daily cron job resets streaks for users who have been inactive beyond the threshold.

The streak counter is visible in the systray widget and on the dashboard.

### Rewards

Managers can create rewards that users redeem by spending XP:

**Reward categories:** Conge (time off), Avantage (perk), Reconnaissance, Personnalise

**Workflow:** Pending -> Approved -> Consumed (or Refused with XP refund)

**Safeguards:**
- XP balance check before claiming
- Optional stock limits (0 = unlimited)
- Optional per-user claim limits
- Full XP refund on refusal

---

## Integrations

Fox Quest hooks into existing modules via model inheritance. All hooks are wrapped in
try/except blocks with warning-level logging to never disrupt core business operations.
A master `gamification_enabled` config parameter acts as a kill switch.

### Timesheets (`account.analytic.line`)

Overrides `create()`. When a timesheet line is created with a project and positive hours:

1. **Hourly XP**: awards `unit_amount * rule.xp_amount` (default: 1 XP per hour)
2. **Daily bonus**: if total hours for the day >= `min_value` (default: 6h), awards a one-time
   daily bonus (default: 5 XP), with duplicate detection

### Tasks (`project.task`)

Overrides `write()`. When a task's stage changes to a folded (done) stage:

1. **Completion XP**: awards XP (default: 5) to the first assigned user
2. **Early completion bonus**: if completed on or before deadline, awards bonus XP (default: 10)

### Knowledge (`project.document`)

Overrides `create()` and `write()`:

- **Document creation**: awards XP (default: 3) to the creator
- **Document revision**: awards XP (default: 2) on meaningful field changes
  (`name`, `content`, `state`, `attachment_ids`, `version_ids`)

### Hosting (`hosting.maintenance.schedule`)

Overrides `write()`. When `last_performed_date` is updated (maintenance marked done):

- Awards XP (default: 2) to the current user

### Messages (`mail.message`)

Overrides `create()`. When a user posts a comment or internal note in the chatter:

- Awards XP (default: 1) per message
- Only triggers for `message_type='comment'` with a non-empty body (system notifications are excluded)

### Helpdesk (`helpdesk.ticket`)

Overrides `write()`. When a ticket's stage changes to a folded (resolved) stage:

- Awards XP (default: 3) to the assigned user or ticket creator

### Activities (`mail.activity`)

Overrides `_action_done()`. When a scheduled activity is marked as done:

- Awards XP (default: 1) to the activity's assigned user
- Captures user info before the activity is unlinked by Odoo

---

## User Interface

### Dashboard

The main dashboard (`ir.actions.client` tag `bf_gamification_dashboard`) provides a single-page
overview built as an OWL component:

- **Profile card** — avatar, name, level badge, title, rank, total XP, progress bar
- **Stats row** — current streak, badge count, weekly XP, monthly XP
- **Leaderboard** — top 10 players with trophy icons for positions 1-3
- **Recent badges** — last 6 earned badges with rarity-colored icons
- **Activity feed** — last 8 XP transactions with source icons and dates
- **Global stats** — total players, total XP awarded, total badges unlocked

### Systray Widget

A compact widget in the top navigation bar (sequence 80), always visible:

- Fire icon + streak count (when streak > 0)
- Star icon + total XP
- Mini progress bar (40px wide) showing progress to next level
- Click opens the dashboard

### Achievement Popup

A centered overlay (z-index 10000) triggered via `bus.bus` when a badge is earned:

- Semi-transparent backdrop
- Rarity-colored top border (gray/green/blue/red/gold)
- Trophy icon, badge name, description, XP reward
- Custom popup message (if configured)
- Optional CSS effects: glow animation, screen shake
- "Genial !" dismiss button
- Auto-closes after 8 seconds

### Level-Up Popup

A full-screen overlay (z-index 10001) triggered on level transitions:

- Dark gradient background matching the new level's tier
- Bouncing gold star animation
- Old level -> New level transition with animated arrow
- New level title in gold
- Total XP badge
- "Continuer" dismiss button

### Key Methods

**`bf.gamification.profile._award_xp(amount, source, description, reference=None)`**

Central method for all XP awards. Creates the transaction, recomputes level, updates streak,
checks for level-up (triggers bus notification), and evaluates automatic badges.

**`bf.gamification.profile._grant_badge(badge, granted_by=None, note=None)`**

Grants a badge to the user, creates an XP bonus transaction for the badge reward, and sends
a bus notification for the achievement popup.

**`bf.gamification.profile._backfill_recent_xp(hours=96)`**

Retroactively awards XP for recent work. Scans timesheets, completed tasks, documents, messages,
and resolved helpdesk tickets within the specified window. Deduplicates against existing
transactions to avoid double-counting. Runs automatically on fresh install (via `post_init_hook`)
and on upgrade (via migration).

**`bf.gamification.dashboard.get_dashboard_data()`**

Single RPC call returning all dashboard data: profile, leaderboard (top 10), recent badges,
XP history (30 days), global stats, and available rewards.
