### Maintenance Templates

Templates allow you to define standard maintenance tasks that are automatically applied when services are activated.

#### Template Types
- **Software-Specific Templates**: Define maintenance tasks specific to each software type (e.g., Nextcloud app updates, Odoo database maintenance)
- **Default Template**: Fallback tasks applied to all services regardless of software (e.g., backup verification, SSL checks)

#### Pre-Populated Templates
The module includes ready-to-use templates for common software:

| Software | Tasks Included |
|----------|----------------|
| **Nextcloud** | Backup setup, admin warnings check (biweekly), app updates (biweekly), DB optimization (monthly), storage cleanup (quarterly) |
| **Vaultwarden** | Backup setup, container updates (monthly), security log review (monthly) |
| **Odoo** | Backup setup, DB maintenance (weekly), module updates (monthly), security audit (quarterly), performance review (quarterly) |
| **CryptPad** | Backup setup, container updates (biweekly), storage cleanup (monthly) |
| **OnlyOffice** | Container updates (monthly), log cleanup (monthly) |
| **PrivateBin** | Container updates (monthly), storage cleanup (quarterly) |
| **Grist** | Backup setup, container updates (monthly) |
| **Default** | Backup setup (1 day after activation), SSL check (monthly), backup verification (monthly) |

#### Template Task Frequencies
- **Once (On Activation)**: One-time setup tasks with optional activity creation
- **Weekly**: Every 7 days
- **Biweekly**: Every 14 days
- **Monthly**: Every 30 days
- **Quarterly**: Every 3 months
- **Biannually**: Every 6 months
- **Yearly**: Every 12 months

#### Auto-Apply on Activation
When a service is activated:
1. The system finds applicable templates (software-specific + default)
2. Creates maintenance schedules for recurring tasks
3. Creates activities for one-time setup tasks
4. Posts a summary to the service chatter

### Preventive Maintenance Schedules
- **Maintenance Task Tracking**: Schedule recurring maintenance tasks for each service
- **Multiple Maintenance Types**: Security patching, database optimization, backup verification, backup setup, log cleanup, container updates, SSL renewal, storage cleanup, performance review, app updates, admin panel checks, security audits, and custom tasks
- **Flexible Frequencies**: Weekly, biweekly, monthly, quarterly, biannually, or yearly schedules
- **Automatic Due Date Calculation**: Next due date computed from last performed date and frequency
- **Overdue Detection**: Visual indicators and filters for overdue maintenance tasks
- **Assignment Tracking**: Assign maintenance tasks to specific users
- **Service Integration**: View and manage maintenance schedules directly from service forms
- **Digest Integration**: Include overdue and upcoming maintenance in email digests
- **Multiple Views**: List, kanban, and calendar views for maintenance schedules

### Activity Integration
- **Automatic Activity Creation**: Maintenance schedules automatically create Odoo activities
- **Activity Inbox**: Tasks appear in the clock icon (activity inbox) for easy tracking
- **Detailed Activity Notes**: Activities include formatted details with service name, client, type, frequency, and instructions
- **Auto-Recreation**: When a task is marked done, a new activity is created for the next due date
- **Activity Feedback**: Completed activities are marked with completion date

### Expiration Management

- **Registrar & DNS Tracking**: Record registrar, DNS provider, registration and expiration dates
- **SSL Certificate Tracking**: Monitor SSL type (Let's Encrypt, commercial, self-signed), issuer, and expiry dates
- **Renewal Reminders**: Automatic activities created for domains and SSL certificates approaching expiration
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Set warning days for domain expiration (default: 60) and SSL expiration (default: 30) in Settings
- **Auto-Expire**: Domains past their expiration date are automatically marked as expired
- **Cost Tracking**: Track annual renewal costs per domain
- **Service Association**: Link domains to services via Many2one relation; stat button shows linked services
- **Dashboard Integration**: Domains section with total, expiring, SSL expiring, and no-auto-renew counts

### Client Portal Integration

## Installation

### Requirements
- Odoo 18.0
- Python packages: `requests` (for health checks and version API calls)
- SSH access configured for Docker version checking (optional)

### Dependencies
- `base`
- `mail`
- `contacts`
- `contract` (OCA Contract module)

### Installation Steps

1. Clone or copy the module to your Odoo addons directory:
   ```bash
   cp -r hosting_management /path/to/odoo/addons/
   ```

2. Update the addons list:
   ```bash
   ./odoo-bin -c odoo.conf -u base --stop-after-init
   ```

3. Install via Odoo Apps menu or command line:
   ```bash
   ./odoo-bin -c odoo.conf -i hosting_management --stop-after-init
   ```

## Configuration

### Settings UI

The module provides a dedicated settings page accessible via **Hosting > Configuration > Settings**. This is the recommended way to configure the module.

#### Health Check Alerts
| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Alert Email | (empty) | Email address for health alert notifications |
| Response Time Threshold | 5000 ms | Response time threshold for slow service warnings |
| Expiration Warning Days | 90 | Days before expiration to create warning activities |

#### Push Notifications (ntfy)
| Setting | Default | Description |

| Token | (empty) | Bearer token for publishing to the ntfy server |
| Topic | `hosting-alerts` | ntfy topic name for hosting alerts |

When configured, push notifications are sent alongside email alerts:
- **Service down/timeout/degraded**: Urgent priority with rotating light icon

| Start Time | 1:30 AM | Start of daily maintenance window |
| End Time | 2:30 AM | End of daily maintenance window |
| Timezone | America/Toronto | Timezone for the maintenance window schedule |

During the maintenance window:
- Health checks continue to run and data is recorded
- Alert emails (down, recovered, slow) are suppressed
- Suppressed events are logged for audit purposes

**Method:** `POST`
**Authentication:** Token-based via `X-Backup-Token` header
**Content-Type:** `application/json`

#### Configuration

1. Set the API token in **Settings → Technical → System Parameters**:
   - Key: `hosting.backup_api_token`
   - Value: A secure random token (e.g., generate with `openssl rand -hex 32`)

2. Store the same token on your backup server (e.g., `/home/user/secrets/backup-api-token`)

#### Request Payload

  -d @backup-report.json \
  https://odoo.example.com/api/hosting/backup/report/public
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "backup_run_id": 42,
  "backup_run_name": "BKP-00042",
  "message": "Backup report created and email sent"
}
```

#### Automated Backup Script Integration

The companion script `backup-all-services.sh` supports two modes:

1. **Direct Odoo API** (recommended):
   ```bash
   WEBHOOK_MODE=odoo ./backup-all-services.sh
   # Or use the flag:
   ./backup-all-services.sh --odoo-direct
   ```

2. **n8n Webhook** (for additional processing):
   ```bash
   N8N_WEBHOOK_URL=https://n8n.example.com/webhook/backup-report ./backup-all-services.sh
   ```

**Additional flags:**
- `--dry-run` - Show what would run without executing
- `--no-webhook` - Run backups but don't send report to Odoo/n8n
- `--no-downtime` - Skip backups that cause service downtime (e.g., Nextcloud maintenance mode)

The token is loaded from `/home/user/secrets/backup-api-token` or the `ODOO_BACKUP_TOKEN` environment variable.

1. Go to Hosting > Configuration > Digests
2. Create a new digest with:
   - Recipients (users who should receive the email)
