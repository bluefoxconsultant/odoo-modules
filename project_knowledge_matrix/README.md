## Features

### KPI Dashboard

The module opens with a comprehensive dashboard showing:

- **Document Overview**: Active, draft, archived, internal, and client document counts
- **Review & Expiration Tracking**: Overdue reviews, expired documents, and upcoming expirations (0-30, 30-60, 60-90 days)

- **Content Quality**: Documents without versions, stale content, software documentation coverage
- **Knowledge Matrices**: Completion rates, blocked items, in-progress items
- **Credentials**: Active, expiring, expired, and revoked credentials
- **Distribution Activity**: Monthly trends and overdue acknowledgments

All dashboard metrics are clickable, navigating directly to filtered views.

**Project Filtering**: A dropdown selector allows filtering all dashboard metrics by project. When filtered, corporate governance metrics (which are company-wide, not project-specific) are hidden. The dashboard can also be opened pre-filtered from a project's smart button.

        string='Client Contact',
        help='Client-side contact for this item'
    )
```

## Technical Notes

### Odoo 18 Compatibility

This module follows Odoo 18 best practices:

- Uses `mail.thread` and `mail.activity.mixin` for collaboration
- Implements `tracking=True` for field change logging
- Uses `@api.depends` for computed stored fields
- Follows naming conventions (`_id` suffix for Many2one, `_ids` for x2many)

### Performance

- Indexed fields on commonly filtered columns (decision_id, state, section_id, phase, priority)
- Stored computed fields for progress statistics and task counts
- Efficient SQL constraints for uniqueness
